# employee-tracker

## description
Built from scratch, this CLI app uses mysql database to store tables of values. With this CLI you can manipulate the data from the command line. You can add a department, add a role, add an employee, view all departments, view all roles, and view all employees. This was done using template literals to have a certain action from inquirer to have user input change the tables from the database.
